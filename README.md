### Langchain-Video-to-text
## a simple way to get a Text Summary of Any Video or Any Voice without even watching or hearing it! We do this by writing a Python code using the LangChain framework.Specifically, we first transcribe the input video using OpenAI's Whisper model to get a text out of the video. We then apply a text summarizer model like OpenAI's Davinci model to summarize the generated text or transcript. To interface with the Davinci model, we use LangChain to create a text summarizer chain. OpenAI's Whisper supports more than 99 different languages!


## LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). It provides a standard interface for interacting with various LLMs and offers a range of tools and integrations for building LLM-powered applications

## The Whisper model from OpenAI is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is capable of performing multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
